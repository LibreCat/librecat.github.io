<h1>Who are we?</h1>
<p>
LibreCat is a group of library developers and enthusiasts who meet at library conferences 
such as ELAG and SWIB and enjoy sharing code to process library (meta)data. 
</p>

<p>
This group was formed in 2013 and created many free and open source tools. This project 
page provides an overview of all the tools the group shares with the rest of the world.
</p>

<p>
We created our tools mainly because they helped us in our own projects. We hope that these 
tools can help you in your own projects. We are not a compagy nor have any funding for any 
helpdesk or extensive support. The code is provided as is. If any questions arise please ask 
the developers of the individual projects for assistence.
</p>
