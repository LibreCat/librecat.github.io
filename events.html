    <h3>Catmandu - Library Oriented Extract, Transform, Load tools to publish Linked Open Data</br><small>SWIB2013, Workshop November 25 - 27 2013, Hamburg</small></h3>
    <p>by Nicolas Steenlant / Patrick Hochstenbach / Najko Jahn Bielefeld University, Germany / Ghent University, Belgium
    </p>

    <h5>Conference Website</h5>

    <a href="http://swib.org/swib13/programme.php">http://swib.org/swib13/programme.php</a>

    <h5>Description</h5>

    <p>
    Creating any data oriented application the main task is to import data from various sources, map the fields to a common data model and put it all into a database or search engine. In data-warehousing, these processes are called ETL — Extract, Transform, Load. Catmandu provides a suite of Perl modules to ease the import, storage, retrieval, export and transformation of metadata records
    </p>

    <p>
    After a short introduction in the rationales of Catmandu and presentation of sample applications at the Universities of Lund, Ghent and Bielefeld, participants will be guided to transform MARC records to Linked Data.  The steps include transforming MARC into a JSON model of choice, storing/indexing the model in ElasticSearch, and exporting/mapping the model as Linked Data.
    </p>

    <p>
    Prior experience: We will be using a simplified ETL language. Any programming experience is welcome but not required. A brief tutorial on Catmandu programming can be found <a href="http://librecat.org/tutorial/">here</a>. 
    Requirements: Laptop with  VirtualBox installed. Organisers will prepare a virtualbox image (Linux guest system) beforehand to be worked with during the workshop.

  <h3>An Open Access workflow to Extract, Transform, Map, and Publish dynamic metadata</br><small>ELAG 2013, Workshop May 29 - 30 2013, Gent</small></h3>


    <p>by Miel Vander Sande, Pieter Colpaert, Erik Mannens (Inspired and assisted by: Patrick Hochstenbach, Dries Moreels)</p>

<h5>Conference Website</h5>

    <a href="http://elag2013.org/ws3-an-open-access-workflow-to-extract-transform-map-and-publish-dynamic-metadata/">http://elag2013.org/ws3-an-open-access-workflow-to-extract-transform-map-and-publish-dynamic-metadata/</a>

    <h5>Description</h5>

    <p>LibreCat is an open collaboration to provide freely available tools for library and research services. It allows a librarian to define a “menu” which can be repeated for dataset extraction, transformation and loading. The DataTank is an Open Source data adapter for publishing Open Data sets.The DataTank is a RESTful data publishing tool. By daisychaning LibreCat and The DataTank’s Input project, we can now also map these data to an ontology and publish the data in a RESTful interface.</p>

<p>The workshop will go deeper into the latter: an ontology will be chosen, a mapping file will be created and a recipe will be scheduled. The data ingested in the triple store (a data base for semantically enriched data), will then be published through a RESTful interface.</p>

<h5>Intended Audience</h5>

<p>Librarians who want the data they are managing lifted towards linked open data.</p>

<h5>Experience</h5>

<p>Knowledge about catmandu/librecat is a plus.</p>

  <h3>Catmandu: boost your data processing with library oriented ETL</br><small>ELAG 2013 Bootcamp May 28 2013, Gent</small></h3>
  	<p>by Nicolas Steenlant</p>

    <h5>Conference Website</h5>

    <a href="http://elag2013.org/bc3-catmandu-boost-your-repository-services-with-library-oriented-etl-processing/">http://elag2013.org/bc3-catmandu-boost-your-repository-services-with-library-oriented-etl-processing/</a>

    <h5>Description</h5>

    <p>To create any data oriented application, one of your recurring tasks will be to import data from various sources, map the fields to a common data model and put it all into a database or search engine.</p>

<p>Stores such as MongoDB or ElasticSearch provide a developer friendly API, but you keep writing a lot of boilerplate or throwaway code. We tried to abstract this problem into a set of Perl tools called Catmandu which can work with library data such as MARC, Dublin Core, EndNote, protocols such as OAI-PMH, SRU and repositories such as DSpace and Fedora.</p>

<p>In data warehouses these processes are called ETL, Extract, Transform, Load. Many (often heavyweight) tools exist for ETL processing but none address typical library data models and services.</p>

<p>In this bootcamp we will provide an introduction into these tools. We will show how easy it is to import data and transform it with the help of a small DSL language. Storing and indexing become one-liners.</p>

<h5>Audience</h5>

<p>Developers, sysadmins</p>

<h5>Expertise</h5>

<p>Importing metadata from various sources, transforming this data into a JSON model of choice, storing/indexing in a (search) engine of choice, provide a REST based API.</p>

<h5>Programming experience</h5>

<p>Scripting languages of choice Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP.</p>

<h5>Required</h5>

<p>Laptop with GNU/Linux or OSX or a Virtual Machine.</p>

    <p>by LibreCat and PubLister team</p>

        <h5>Conference Website</h5>

        <a href="https://github.com/LibreCat/Catmandu/wiki/Bielefeld-Workshop-November-29-30-2012">https://github.com/LibreCat/Catmandu/wiki/Bielefeld-Workshop-November-29-30-2012</a>

        <h5>Description</h5>

        <p>
We would like to invite you to the joint PubLister/LibreCat Software Developer Workshop on 29 and 30 November 2012 (1 - 7pm ; 9am - 2pm CEST) at Bielefeld University.
            </p>

            <p>
Building off last year's PubLister Symposium and Workshop <a href="http://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/workshop/">http://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/workshop/</a>, the University Libraries of Lund, Gent and Bielefeld share the common vision of
            </p>

            <p>
            <ol>
    <li>Creating a high-level system of building blocks that can be reused when creating repository-like applications: Project Catmandu</li>
    <li>Creating a next-generation repository service based on these building blocks: Project LibreCat.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <p><a href="http://librecat.org/">http://librecat.org/</a></p>

            <p>
After showcasing exemplary implementations at the three Universities, the workshop will get you started building repository applications with Catmandu. The sources needed are distributed both via CPAN <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?m=all&q=catmandu">http://search.cpan.org/search?m=all&q=catmandu</a> and GitHub <a href="https://github.com/LibreCat">https://github.com/LibreCat</a>. A brief tutorial can be found here:

 <h3>Bridging the Gap between Personal Publication Lists and Institutional Services - PubLister Symposium and Workshop</br><small>23 and 24 March 2011 - Bielefeld University</small></h3>
    <p>by PubLister team</p>

    <h5>Conference Website</h5>

                <p><a href="http://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/workshop/">http://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/workshop/</a></p>

                <h5>Description</h5>

                <p>The event introduces the history, rationales and the future of the repository software SBCAT, which has been developed at <a href="http://lup.lub.lu.se/">Lund University Libraries</a> and
 <a href="http://biblio.ugent.be/input">Ghent University Library</a>. 
Adopted and customised at Bielefeld University Library, <a href="http://pub.uni-bielefeld.de">PUB</a> has been the official research database of Bielefeld University since November 3rd 2010.</p>

<p>PUB provides Bielefeld University faculty with a single entry-point to register personal publications in order to promote their research within and across the university, e.g. on the 
<a href="http://ekvv.uni-bielefeld.de/pers_publ/publ/PersonPublikationen.jsp?personId=15282606">Directory of Staff and Departments</a>, <a href="http://www2.physik.uni-bielefeld.de/okacz_pub.html">personal webpages</a>
 and those of <a href="http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/%28en%29/theologie/forschung/religionsforschung/publikationen/index.html">departments</a>. Up to now, more than 12,500 records have been registered. For projects and research groups, registration and flexible web-presentations will be launched soon.</p>

<p>At the Symposium, researchers describe from a first-hand perspective their needs for maintaining publication records and documents. 
With the <a href="http://sfb673.ub.uni-bielefeld.de">CRC PrePrint Server</a>, the PubLister project has served the Bielefeld Collaborative Research Centre <a href="http://www.sfb673.org/">SFB 673 Alignment in Communication</a>
to disseminate its publication-based research output to the funder during a successful mid-term evaluation. Recently, the SFB Preprint Server has been adopted by another SFB based at Bielefeld University.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://phillister.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/index.php/publist">PhilLister</a>, the PubLister project has developed a lightweight service that allows flexible storage
 and dissemination of <a href="http://phillister.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/publication/961">philosophical papers</a> on <a href="http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/philosophie/personen/beckermann/xbiblio.html">personal</a>
 and <a href="http://phillister.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/person/310"> departmental </a> webpages.</p>

<p>In joint collaboration with the <a href="http://www.cit-ec.de">Cognitive Interaction Technology &ndash; Center of Excellence (CITEC)</a>, strategies are developed to 
share and synchronize publication and research information with solutions already existing at a central scientific institute of Bielefeld University 
(i.e. <a href="http://www.sc.cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.de/de/biblio">Drupal Biblio)</a>.</p>

<p>Integrating diverse data sources has been one of the main challenges during the project. With regard to this, the section &quot;Data&quot; firstly analyses vocabularies
 needed for enriching publication records with research information available at an academic institution such as data about persons, organisation, projects, and events.
 An approach to identify authors and organisations on the basis of the literature databases &quot;Scopus&quot; and &quot;ISI Web of Science&quot; as part of the
 <a href="http://www.research-information.de/Projekte/Bibliometrics/projekte_bibliometrics.asp">&quot;German Competence Centre for Bibliometrics&quot;</a> will be introduced.</p>

<p>The second day starts with the presentation of alternative repository-based approaches. For instance, the deployment of EPrints  <a href="http://epub.uni-regensburg.de"> The University of Regensburg Publication Server</a> will be presented just as <a href="http://puma.uni-kassel.de/?lang=en">PUMA &ndash; Academic Publication Management</a> developed at the University of Kassel, which is based on
 <a href="http://bibsonomy.blogspot.com/2009/08/puma-project-on-academic-publication.html">Bibsonomy</a> technology.</p>

In the following, three workshops allow for a more detailed discussion and sharing of experiences. The workshop &quot;PUB Live Demo&quot; aims at discussion about the software developed and in use. 
The workshop &quot;Workflows&quot; deals with supporting strategies for populating institutional repositories and supporting researchers. &quot;Applied Metadata Programming and Modelling&quot;
invites developers interested in the broader context of academic publications.</p>
